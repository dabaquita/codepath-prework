## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added Settings Page
- [X] Added slider instead of control picker

## Notes

I have had experience programmatically building iOS apps, so starting with the Storyboard feature felt a little alien to me instead of purely using written code to manipulate the elements. Although I did this to save on time, it also helped me learn a bit more about the Storyboard and various shortcuts. Very fun experience getting back to the basics!
